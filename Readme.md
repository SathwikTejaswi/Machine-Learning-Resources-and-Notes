# Machine Learning Resources

Being an ML enthuiast, I am always on the look out for resources that would help me to better understand the math and the algorithmic perspective of machine learning. Every time I find a new Lecture video series/Lecture notes/Reference books etc, I update this repository.

NOTE : 
- I do not own copyrights to any of the materials that have been listed here. 
- The links that I have posted below might not be active currently. In case you found some please let me know and I will update the repository accordingly
